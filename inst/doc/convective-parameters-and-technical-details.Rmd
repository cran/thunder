All CAPE parameters are calculated by integrating parcel's positive
buoyancy between level of free convection (LFC) and equilibrium level
(EL). All CIN parameters are calculated by integrating parcel negative
buoyancy between parcel initialization height and level of free
convection (LFC). Most-unstable (MU) parcel is defined based on the
highest theta-e between surface and 3 km above ground level (AGL). A
default mixed-layer (ML) parcel is calculated by averaging theta and
mixing ratio over 0--500 m AGL layer and initializing from surface. If
other user-defined parcel lifting options are choosen, all parameters
that use mixed-layer (ML) parcel (e.g. STP_new) will now use a
user-defined manual-lift (ML) parcel.

## Accuracy tables for `sounding_compute()`

The interpolation algorithm used in the `sounding_compute()` function
impacts accuracy of parameters such as CAPE or CIN and the performance
of the script. The valid options for the `accuracy` parameter are 1, 2
or 3:

`accuracy = 1` - High performance but low accuracy. Dedicated for large
dataset when output data needs to be quickly available (e.g. operational
numerical weather models). This option is around 20 times faster than
high accuracy (3) setting. Interpolation is peformed for 60 levels (m
AGL):

```{r accuracy1, echo = FALSE}
c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3200, 3400, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4200, 4400, 4600, 4800, 5000, 5200, 5400, 5600, 5800, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, 10500, 11000, 11500, 12000, 12500, 13000, 13500, 14000, 15000, 16000, 17000, 18000, 19000, 20000)
```

`accuracy = 2` - Compromise between script performance and accuracy.
Recommended for efficient processing of large numerical weather
prediction datasets such as meteorological reanalyses for research
studies. This option is around 10 times faster than high accuracy (3)
setting. Interpolation is peformed for 318 levels (m AGL):
